										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty for all the way long He has been intervening in my affairs! My name is Regina and I am a nurse from Ghana. On Friday 12<sup>th </sup>May 2023, I began feeling unwell. The following day on Saturday, I couldn&#8217;t get out of bed. I was completely down with fever, chills, catarrh, severe cough, severe headache, difficulty in breathing, malaise, severe lower back pain and overall general body pain. I was very weak, unable to eat or even drink water. I started treatment immediately but things got worse. I was at my worse by Sunday and I thought I was going to die. The treatment I was receiving seemed not to be yielding any positive results.</p>



<p>So, I sent an email to God&#8217;s Heart TV, believing God that He would settle my case. A few hours after sending the email, I had a warm sensation all over my body and I began to sweat profusely. I sweat so much – like never before! I began to feel as if I was sweating out all the sickness in my body. It started from my lower back and spread all over my body but after about three hours of constant sweating, I began to feel better! The fever, chills, headache, backache, body pains all left me and I started feeling hungry. I ate and drank water &#8211; and it was as though I was never sick at all! Now, I am completely fine and made whole to the glory of God.</p>



<p>I also have another God’s Heart TV testimony! I used to experience setback in everything I did and could not maintain any leadership position given to me. This spirit of limitation and near success-syndrome tormented me so much to the extent that I was made to serve under my juniors at work for so many years. The reproach was just unbearable! I sent my prayer request to God’s Heart TV and was opportune to partake in the Interactive Prayer Service. Then in March 2023, I was called into the office of the Nurse Manager and given an appointment letter as the Nurse in-charge of the Medical Ward of the hospital. I was also appointed as the focal person for effective documentation among nurses in the hospital. So instead of serving under my juniors as I used to, I am now in charge of the nurses! This can only be God! I believe that God, who has started this good work in my life, will perfect all that concerns me &#8211; to the glory of God. Thank You, Jesus Christ, is the response from my grateful heart. Thank you, Brother Chris, for allowing yourself to be used by God and for being on your knees for us always.”</p>

<p>“Grace and peace unto you! My name is Mmathapelo from South Africa and I was opportune to join the Interactive Prayer Service with Brother Chris in April 2023. When I submitted my prayer request, I was on the verge of giving up. Life was just upside down for me in every area. No matter how much I prayed and fasted or how dedicated I was as a child of God, the challenges just seemed too much. I was facing joblessness for over fifteen years and had lost hope. I also had evil dreams, bad luck, failure in everything I tried to succeed in, setbacks, stagnancy, disappointment… the list was endless!</p>



<p>But the major problem was in my finances as I was jobless for so many years. It was really difficult to make ends meet and I also suffered rejection in my family. No one wanted to associate with me because I had been jobless for so long. I watched everyone detach themselves from me, rendering me a loner and isolated. The people I loved lost interest in me. I couldn&#8217;t even go to family gatherings as I had no proper clothes or even money to put on the table to support whatever function being held. I suffered silently and it slowly led to depression. I saw snakes in my dream and had such bad nightmares that I didn&#8217;t even want to sleep anymore.</p>



<p>I began following Brother Chris on Facebook and by God’s grace, I was opportune to be join the Interactive Prayer Service in April and then the Word of Encouragement Service on April 22<sup>nd</sup> 2023. On the April 26<sup>th</sup>, the day after my birthday, I received a call from an Airline company to come for an interview. Because of many disappointments, I didn&#8217;t even take the call seriously, thinking it would be like every other time where I would receive calls but nothing happened. So, when a date for the interview was communicated, I became very nervous! On May 1<sup>st</sup> 2023, I went for an interview at a company named ‘FlyFofa Airways and Aviation Training’. It is both an airline and a training school for pilots. I was called in a department where they train student pilots. By the grace of God, on that day of the interview, I secured myself a permanent post! And to the glory of God, I started work the following day on May 2<sup>nd</sup> 2023! I would like to give thanks to God Almighty who saw me through and had mercy on me! Thank God for God&#8217;s Heart TV and Brother Chris for the Interactive Prayer Services! I am no longer jobless now. Thank You, Jesus Christ!!!”</p>

<p>During a recent visit to the nation of Colombia, Brother Chris and Allison led the God’s Heart TV Team on a charitable mission in a deprived neighbourhood in the city of Cali. Supporting the work of Pastor Cristina Moreno, who runs an outreach centre in her church which weekly feeds single mothers in the local community, the God’s Heart TV Team provided large packs of food and hygiene items to over fifty less privileged families.</p>



<p>During the event, Brother Chris shared a word of encouragement with all in attendance and thanked them for receiving the gifts. He said, “God’s love for you is not determined by your current condition or your past mistakes. God’s love for you is not determined by your family background or circumstance of birth. He loves you because He is your Creator; He is the Source of love. Don’t fall into the trap of believing God doesn’t love you because of what you are passing through.”</p>



<p>Apart from the large packs of food which contained essential items, the God’s Heart TV Team also gave refreshments to all who came. At the end of the event, an additional gift was given to Pastor Cristina to encourage her continued commitment to support the community.</p>

<p>“My name is Thandi from South Africa. God is good all the time! The Lord has done a miracle in my life. The last appointment I had with my doctor a few months ago, I was told that my kidney was damaged to the last stage and things were not looking good. Brother Chris then prayed for me during the Interactive Prayer Service on April 1st and when I went to the doctor’s appointment today, they&nbsp;were shocked to realise that my kidney is now healed and my life is out of danger! Praise the Lord! The doctors kept asking me what is it that I did or maybe drank to help me and I told them it’s all the Lord’s work.”</p>

<p>“My name is Horace from Jamaica. I used to have huge marital issues, where both me and my wife were seeking to get a divorce. I saw <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialbrotherchris?__cft__[0]=AZXEj5b7QgOqzthGdYy8VPFzZtRpSIVohEVHnFOeEpgnCM1g3NvB3NkAl9V20hGQVN8Xy3m0a7KCOB8F6AML28-uYdj_l89nLng97qrsXkYVplZREMJgCMEt8WuPBa-RQuW9ZknsBg-Q1BX_-I3S6lltXTnWTnl2LODsRlCyY3S-oBv_X9Xd9xK_vyzapoZYsXw&amp;__tn__=-]K-R">Brother Chris</a> on YouTube and contacted God’s Heart TV. I got invited to an Interactive Prayer Service on Zoom. On that morning, I called my wife. She was also having great pain when it was her time of the month &#8211; huge pain and a great loss of blood. That morning, Brother Chris prayed for us. I didn’t feel <a></a>anything; she didn’t feel much either. She said she just felt like a cool breeze pass her stomach.</p>



<p>But guess what? That was good enough! God works wonders because she was healed of that pain and that loss of blood is no more. Glory to God! And our marriage is as great as ever. God has reconciled us! And we thank the Lord Jesus Christ, who has worked through Brother Chris.</p>



<p>Brother Chris, I know you are doing a great job for God. I pray that you will continue to do your great work, for you have helped a lot of people around the world. And I think it’s just begun! And for all those who are watching &#8211; please, don’t give up on God. He has done it for me; He can do it for you also.”</p>

<p>“My name is Denny from Zambia. I had been struggling to get a job for the past three years. In the midst of this struggle, I remembered the Interactive Prayer Service – because I am an ardent follower of God&#8217;s Heart TV and had been watching Brother Chris being used mightily by God under Prophet TB Joshua. So, I requested for Interactive Prayer, explaining my challenges and was opportune to attend the Interactive Prayer Service with Brother Chris in September 2022.</p>



<p>“Soon afterwards in December, I received a call from somewhere I never expected, asking me to go for an interview. I attended the interviews and after one month, I was called and given my employment letter! So, I started working in March 2023! Thank You, Jesus! After this breakthrough, I am convinced that this is just the beginning of my testimonies because I know we have a bright and great future in Christ Jesus. My encouragement to everyone facing any kind of challenge of life is to seek God – for with Him, everything is possible!”</p>

<p>“My name is Becky from Kenya and I want to testify to what God has done in my life. I am an online writer and during this season, jobs haven&#8217;t been much available. However, I joined an Interactive Prayer Service with Brother Chris and immediately after he prayed for us, people of God, I started receiving jobs double than before! I also had back pain for so many years but by the grace of God it has also gone! I am grateful to God for my healing and breakthrough. My advice is this: God is the Author and Finisher of our life story. We might run to people for help but the main help we need is from above. May God bless everyone. Thank you!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“My name is Emily from the United Kingdom. I had previously been having severe pains and aches during my menstruation, sometimes even missing it. I never thought much of it until we were looking to conceive. My sister wrote a prayer request to God&#8217;s Heart TV and was invited to the Interactive Prayer Service in May 2022. I joined the prayer session with her. After the prayer, we immediately received the fruit of the womb.</p>



<p>My pregnancy journey wasn&#8217;t easy. The sonographers discovered a large fibroid during my first scan although thankfully it was on the outside of my womb. The doctors were worried about the effects this would have on the baby and myself, in case it was growing as the baby was growing. It was alright until one night where I felt a prolonged extreme, acute pain. The pain was very bad! I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night and had to call off at work. I informed my midwife and she was very concerned. She decided to flag up my situation to the obstetrician and I was classed as high risk. Since then, I was visiting the hospital every month for a scan.</p>



<p>In November 2022, I was encouraged to apply for the Interactive Prayer for not only the pregnancy but also because we were looking for a permanent place to live. By God&#8217;s grace, we had the opportunity to be prayed for Brother Chris. Before long, the awaited month arrived. My baby came 10 days before her due date. I thank God I had a relatively uncomplicated delivery with no trouble from the fibroid. For a first-time pregnancy everyone commented how fast the labour went. The doctors were concerned that I would lose a lot of blood, so during labour the obstetrician came to the delivery suite to ask me – if worst came to worst – whether I would want a blood transfusion. I was reluctant to have any transfusion or think of the worst-case scenario whilst having contractions. I think they were worried because of the known large fibroid. The doctors knew what was going on but didn&#8217;t want to tell me the reality so that I don&#8217;t panic. God knew my thoughts. I called for His help and He pulled me through.</p>



<p>Immediately the baby was out, I was suddenly surrounded by about seven to eight midwives and the obstetrician, who were all ready to attend to me. It was amazing. Although I lost about 800ml of blood and had a second-degree tear, my blood count loss was surprisingly lower than they expected and both baby and myself were in good health. I knew God was on hand that day. I can&#8217;t stop thanking Him for His grace and rescue!</p>



<p>We had a double blessing that week. Our house purchase was completed three days after the baby&#8217;s birth. We now have a place to call home all for the Glory of God. I&#8217;m now a full-time mum and very much enjoying motherhood. Thank You, God, for these blessings. Thank you to Brother Chris and all of God&#8217;s Heart TV Team for caring and praying for us. My advice is in <strong><em>2 Corinthians 12:9: &#8220;But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me&#8221; </em></strong>and in <strong><em>Ephesians 6:10: &#8220;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might&#8221;.</em></strong></p>

<p>“Grace and peace to you all at God&#8217;s Heart TV! I am blessed and grateful to testify of the goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ. I was tormented by unclean spirits in my house, mostly in my bedroom. During the prayer with Brother Chris, my feet became very cold till the end of the prayer. That very same night after prayer, I slept and was surprised to wake up in the morning with no disturbance! Usually around 2am to 3am, I would feel the presence of the evil spirit in the room and would wake up. After the prayer, God&#8217;s mercy and favour has located us and we are able to sleep peacefully! We thank God Almighty for the deliverance. We would also like to thank Brother Chris and God&#8217;s Heart TV Team for their dedication and the love given to us.&nbsp; Amen! Jesus is Lord!” – Mahlodi, South Africa</p>
